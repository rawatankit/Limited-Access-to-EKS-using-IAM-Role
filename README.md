# Limited-Access-to-EKS-using-IAM-Role

There are some case where we want to share the .kubeconfig file of EKS or Kubernetes Environment with our Team members but to share kubeconfig file gives full access as well and not a best/safe practice.

To Resolve this issue we can use this document or repo to provide access to EKS to any user based on AWS-IAM Role.
